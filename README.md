# DmTools by VTG
This is a unique software, that i decided to make, because i couldn't find anything that would work natively on desktop,
without any payment or nessesity to open browser. So, here it is! Its aimed on dungeon masters, who would like to make 
their life easier and get rid of dozens of tabs with different random generators or information, because this app is going
to have them all!
## Release date
I'm planning to make first alpha version publically available on the 21st of January
